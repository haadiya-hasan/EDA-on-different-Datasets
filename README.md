# EDA-on-different-Datasets
This repository contains 10 different datasets, each analyzed independently to demonstrate practical skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The goal of this project is to understand data patterns, clean raw datasets, extract meaningful insights, and visualize trends across varied domains.
